# NAME

ExobrainPipeline - plugin based application for letting Perl think for you

# DESCRIPTION

ExobrainPipeline is an application implementing a data pipeline and plugins
to let Perl automate your life.  Plugins can aggregate iCal feeds,
quantified-self data, etc that get passed on to other plugins generating daily
emails, complete goals on https://tdp.me , etc.

Design of [ExobrainPipeline](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?ExobrainPipeline) is largely based on [Dist::Zilla](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Dist::Zilla) and ideas from
Ricardo Signes & Paul Fenwick.
